# ðŸ—³ Voting


Voting gives a voice to the Bitexblock community, letting the community have a say in how Bitexblock develops into the future.

**Core** - proposals posted by the Bitexblock team. The results will be actioned.

**Community** - proposals posted by the Bitexblock community. These are used to propose ideas and show the communities point of view. The Bitexblock team reviews every community vote and will often move any with strong community support up to the CORE proposal level.
