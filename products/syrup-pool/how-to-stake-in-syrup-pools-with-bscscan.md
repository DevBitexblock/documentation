# How to Stake in Syrup Pools with BscScan


Some users may want to take advantage of Bitexblock's Syrup Pools using BscScan instead of the website UI.

You'll be interacting with one of two contracts, depending on if you want to use the Auto BIT Syrup Pool, or one of the other available Syrup Pools. This guide will help you through interacting with the contracts and get you stacking those sweet, syrupy rewards.

{% hint style="warning" %}
Please understand that using BscScan to interact with contracts is not recommended for beginners. If you're not feeling confident, we suggest using the [How to Stake in Syrup Pools guide](https://docs.bitexblock.com/products/syrup-pool/syrup-pool-guide) instead.
