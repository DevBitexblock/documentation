# SYRUP \(Staking\)

**Stack your BIT with syrup.**

* 25% of BIT emissions will be distributed to SYRUP holders every block. Users can claim these rewards and re-invest them.
* BIT holders can swap BIT for SYRUP at a 1:1 ratio.
* BIT is distributed proportionally at each block based on SYRUP holdings.
* We will only record and distribute BIT rewards to the wallet address that initiated the SYRUP staking. While Syrup can be sent to other addresses only the initiating address will receive the BIT rewards,
